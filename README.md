# Test-Case-Bug-Reports

🧪 About the Project : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This project focuses on writing and executing test cases for the futurenation web application. The goal is to ensure these features function correctly and reliably under different conditions.

✅ Pre-requisites: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <be>
<br>
Microsoft Excel (used for documenting test cases and bug reports)

🧾 What is a Test Case? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <be>
<br>
A test case is a documented set of actions, inputs, and expected results designed to verify a particular feature or functionality of a software application. If a test case fails, it often indicates a defect that needs investigation and resolution.


💡 Why Test Cases Matter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <be>
<br>
Ensure all features meet functional requirements

1. Validate system behavior under different scenarios
2. Improve software quality and reliability
3. Help uncover hidden defects early in the development cycle

🔧 Why Bug Reporting is Important &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
1. Keeps the development team informed of defects
2. Enhances communication between testers and developers
3. Ensures faster resolution and improved user experience
4. Maintains software integrity and stability
