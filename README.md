# Test-Case-Bug-Reports
Test Cases: A test case is a defined set of actions and conditions designed to verify a specific application function or feature. If a test case fails, it may indicate a software defect that can be identified, documented, and prioritized for resolution. 

Bug Reports: A bug report is a documented record of an issue or flaw in a software application that causes it to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly. It is a communication bridge between testers, developers, and stakeholders to ensure product quality.
